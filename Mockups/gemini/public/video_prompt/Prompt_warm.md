## Segment 1: Introduction

**Script Context**: "I'm so excited to dive into one of the most fascinating concepts in psychology today: Classical Conditioning. It's how we learn!"
**Visual Prompt**:

> A medium shot of a friendly female AI instructor standing in a modern, sunlit virtual classroom. She is smiling broadly and waving slightly with her hand in a welcoming gesture. Her facial expression is enthusiastic and engaging. She leans forward slightly, showing genuine interest. The background has soft, warm amber lighting. High quality, photorealistic.

## Segment 2: The Unconditioned Response

**Script Context**: "So, picture a hungry dog. When you give it a bowl of food, it automatically starts drooling. It can't help it! That's what we call an Unconditioned Response."
**Visual Prompt**:

> A close-up shot of the female AI instructor. She is smiling gently and using expressive hand gestures to illustrate a point. To her right, a holographic icon of a dog and a food bowl appears floating in the air. She looks at the diagram with a pleased expression, then back at the camera with warm eye contact. Her nodding is encouraging. Warm, inviting atmosphere.

## Segment 3: The Neutral Stimulus 
**Script Context**: "Now, here's the twist. What happens if we just ring a bell? *Ding!* Nothing, right? The dog doesn't care. The bell is just a neutral noise at this point."
**Visual Prompt**:

> Medium shot. The instructor adopts a playful, curious expression, raising her eyebrows slightly. She mimics ringing a bell with her hand. A floating hologram of a bell appears. She laughs softly (visually) and shrugs her shoulders in a friendly way to indicate "nothing happens." Her body language is relaxed and open. Warm lighting highlights her face.

## Segment 4: The Association

**Script Context**: "But... if we ring the bell *every time* we bring the food, magic happens. The dog learns to connect the two. Soon, the bell alone makes the dog drool!"
**Visual Prompt**:
> Medium-close shot. The instructor looks amazed and excited, eyes widening slightly to emphasize the "magic" of learning. She brings her hands together to simulate connecting two ideas. The holographic dog, bell, and food merge into a diagram. She points to it with an open palm and a satisfied, encouraging smile. The scene ends with her nodding approvingly at the viewer.
