## Segment 1: Intro & Unconditioned Response (0-15s)
**Script Context**: " Consider a biological subject, specifically a canine. Upon the presentation of a nutritional stimulus, the subject exhibits an involuntary salivation reflex. This physiological reaction is formally classified as the Unconditioned Response. It is an innate biological mechanism requiring no prior training."
**Visual Prompt**:

> Medium shot of a female AI instructor in a sterile, blue-lit tech studio. She stands perfectly rigid, hands clasped in front of her. Her expression is blank and emotionless. A holographic dog and food icon appears; she does not look at it, keeping her gaze fixed intensely on the camera lens. Her speaking movements are minimal and efficient.

## Segment 2: The Learning Process (15-30s)
**Script Context**: "Initially, introducing an auditory stimulus, such as a ringing bell, elicits no physiological response. However, by systematically pairing the auditory stimulus with the nutritional stimulus over multiple trials, a neural association is established. The subject's cognitive processing begins to correlate the unrelated auditory input with the subsequent arrival of sustenance."
**Visual Prompt**:

> Medium shot. The instructor remains motionless except for her mouth. A holographic bell appears. She tilts her head slightly to the side, robotically, to indicate the transition. Her eyes do not blink often. The lighting is stark, creating sharp shadows. She displays no enthusiasm or variation in facial muscle tension.

## Segment 3: The Result & Conclusion (30-45s)
**Script Context**: "Consequently, the auditory stimulus alone becomes sufficient to trigger the salivation reflex. The previously neutral bell is now designated as the Conditioned Stimulus. This transformation demonstrates the successful acquisition of an associative learning pattern. The conditioning protocol is now complete. We will proceed to the next data module immediately."
**Visual Prompt**:
> Close-up shot. The instructor stares blankly at the viewer. The holographic diagram updates mechanically. She does not gesture. Her tone implies a statement of fact rather than a celebration of learning. The video ends with her staring silently into the camera, fading to black without a smile or sign-off gesture.
