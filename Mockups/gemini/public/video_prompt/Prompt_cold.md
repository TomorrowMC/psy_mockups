# AI Video Generation Prompts - Cold Condition
**Character**: "Aura" (Female AI Instructor), professional business formal attire, dark/neutral colors.

**Style**: Photorealistic, 4k, high definition.



## Segment 3: The Neutral Stimulus

**Script Context**: "Next, we introduce an auditory stimulus: a bell. The subject demonstrates no physiological response. The bell acts as a Neutral Stimulus."
**Visual Prompt**:

> Medium shot. The instructor's expression is blank and analytical. A floating hologram of a bell appears next to her. She does not react to it. Her movements are sharp and precise, lacking fluidity. She tilts her head slightly to the side in a mechanical way. The lighting is stark and cold, emphasizing the lack of emotion.

## Segment 4: The Association 

**Script Context**: "However, pairing the bell with the food creates a neural association. Consequently, the Neutral Stimulus alone becomes sufficient to elicit the response."
**Visual Prompt**:
> Medium-close shot. The instructor delivers the conclusion with a monotone visual affect. No change in facial muscle tension. The holographic dog, bell, and food merge into a diagram. She gestures towards it with a stiff hand motion, palm flat. She maintains intense, unwavering eye contact with the camera. The scene ends with her standing perfectly still.
