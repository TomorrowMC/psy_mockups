I think that your technical adaptation looks good, however, this study is pretty close to the original, and I think the outcome is pretty predictable. One way to modify is to adjust the cold condition where the AI instructor is exhibiting **neutral** expressions / gestures instead of neutral and explicitly negative negative. You can still work with warm vs. cold, but I think you could differentiate a bit from the original study model, and likely get more interesting results if the cold condition is more neutral and robotic in the sense that you would naturally expect from an AI / robot. Let me know what you think! 

Both figures 1 and 2 are missing error bars. You always want to ensure you add error bars.
